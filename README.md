## Build Setup

First, you need to clone the repo down to your local machine.  
Go to the directory where this will be installed and:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pgeliebter/crypto-dreams-backend.git
$ cd crypto-dreams-backend
```

Next, you need to install gems by doing:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

After that we need to change the Master key to the correct one in order to unlock our API key for Shrimpy.
Open the folder and 
```bash
$ rails credentials:edit
```

Lastly, in order to run in development mode:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
